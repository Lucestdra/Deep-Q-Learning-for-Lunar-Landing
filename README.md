# Deep-Q-Learning-for-Lunar-Landing
This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Q-Learning (DQN) agent to solve the Lunar Lander environment from OpenAI's Gym. The goal of the Lunar Lander environment is to control a spacecraft and land it safely on a designated landing pad, simulating the challenges of lunar landing missions.
